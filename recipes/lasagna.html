    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>cooking spray</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
<li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
<li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
<li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1 pinch dried basil</li>
<li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>
<li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li></ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place spinach in the water and boil until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes. Remove spinach with a slotted spoon, pressing out excess water. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook lasagna in the same boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until well combined.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
